# T5 Summarization Project
## Overview
This project implements text summarization using the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model developed by Google. T5 is a versatile model that treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem, making it suitable for a range of tasks, including summarization.

## Features
* Summarizes long texts into concise summaries.
* Utilizes a pre-trained T5 model for efficient and high-quality summarization.
* Supports customization of input text and summary length.

## Requirements
### You will need the following libraries:
* TensorFlow: For building and training the model.
* Keras: For high-level neural networks API.
* NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
* Attention: For implementing attention mechanisms.
* Scikit-learn: For data processing and model evaluation.

## You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
 pip install tensorflow keras nltk attention scikit-learn
